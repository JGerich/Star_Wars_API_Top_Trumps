# Star_Wars_API_Top_Trumps
Fun and egaging way to practice my programming skills while creating Top Trumps game using Python.

Top Trumps is a card game where each card contains several attributes, and players compare the values of a 
chosen attribute. The player with the higher value wins the round and takes the cards.

*Here's a simple implementation of a Top Trumps game in Python:*
- Define the Card and Deck Classes
- Each card will have multiple attributes
- A deck will be a collection of cards.

*The basic flow of the games is:*
1. You are given a random card with different stats 
2. You select one of the card's stats 
3. Another random card is selected for your opponent (the computer) 
4. The stats of the two cards are compared 
5. The player with the stat higher than their opponent wins
